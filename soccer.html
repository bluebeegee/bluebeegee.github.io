	<p>Barcelona, is one of my favorite teams from the spanish league. The reason is one of my favorite  teams is because they all play as a team not as individuals. In every game,every player does their job right making it interesting and fun to watch. Soccer has  been in my family, my dad plays soccer, my brother, and my boyfriend too. So it just something we enjoy as a hobbie.</p>
